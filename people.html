          <h3>LESLIE KNOPE</h3>
          <h4>Deputy Director</h4>
          <p>As a child, Leslie found a loving, diverse, active family in the many community programs offered by the wonderful city government of Pawnee. She vowed early on to give back to this vibrant and fascinating town by living a life of public service.</p>

          <h4>Administrator</h4>
          <p>Some call Thomas Montgomery Haverford a hero. He calls himself just another public servant doing his best to make sure everyone in the city is healthy, happy and safe. If that makes him a hero, well, then, so be it. He’s a hero.</p>

          <h4>Asst. to Ron Swanson</h4>
          <p>April Ludgate-Dwyer was born in Bjork’s house in Iceland and grew up on Easter Island, where her parents were giant stone heads. She has the ability to fire beams of tacos out of her hands and she can turn her legs into tigers.</p>

          <h3>DONNA MEAGLE</h3>
          <h4>Permits Secretary</h4>
          <p>Donna Meagle is primarily holding it down at the permits desk, but she can be found holding it down all over Pawnee. What is “it”? Probably a good-looking member of the opposite sex. Donna is a busy woman. During the NFL off-season, you can find her in Miami most weekends, so please keep that in mind when putting in a permit request – she will get back to you when she gets back to you.</p>

          <h4>Office Manager</h4>
          <p>Jerry Gergich has been working in the Parks Department for over 30 years. He has a lovely wife and three beautiful daughters whom he loves very much. He is happy to do whatever is asked of him around the office, and couldn’t be more proud to spend each day with the Parks staff, working to make Pawnee a better place to live. Jerry’s most recent project was overseeing the new Parks website information, for which he owes a huge debt of gratitude to Donna Meagle for backing it up on a hard drive. (Crashes happen, especially to this guy – not a computerhead, folks!)</p>

          <h4>Asst. to Leslie Knope</h4>
          <p>Andy Dwyer (aka Andy Radical) loves working at the Parks Department. Mr. Radical does whatever Leslie needs him to get done: making copies, doing paperwork, building forts out of boxes, testing her food to make sure no one is trying to poison her. THAT’S what being an assistant/secret agent/spy/aspiring cop/guy still somewhat thinking about returning to shoe-shining is all about!</p>
